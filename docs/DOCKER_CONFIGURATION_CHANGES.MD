# Docker Configuration Changes

## Overview

This document details all Docker configuration changes made during the AWS Lightsail deployment on August 12, 2025.

## Modified Files

### 1. shard-with-autopropose.yml

**Location**: `f1r3fly/docker/shard-with-autopropose.yml`

#### Health Check Configuration

**Original Configuration**:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "python", "-c", "import requests; requests.get('http://localhost:8080/health', timeout=5)"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s
```

**Final Configuration**:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "test", "-f", "/proc/1/exe"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s
```

**Reason for Change**:
- AutoPropose service didn't implement HTTP health endpoint on port 8080
- Process-based health check more reliable than non-existent HTTP endpoint
- `/proc/1/exe` check verifies main container process is running

### 2. SSH Configuration (Control Machine)

**Location**: `~/.ssh/config`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Removed invalid line: `EOF < /dev/null`
- Removed duplicate `Host devnet` entry
- Cleaned up malformed configuration

**Final Configuration**:
```
Host devnet
    HostName 54.254.197.253
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile /home/ubuntu/code/asi-chain/devnet.pem
```

## Backup Files Created

| Original File | Backup Location | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| shard-with-autopropose.yml | shard-with-autopropose.yml.backup | Preserve original health check |
| autopropose.py | autopropose.py.backup | Safety backup (no changes kept) |

## Files NOT Modified

These files were reviewed but no changes were necessary:

1. **observer.yml** - No modifications needed
2. **validator4.yml** - No modifications needed
3. **autopropose/autopropose.py** - Reverted to original after testing
4. **autopropose/config.yml** - Default configuration works correctly
5. **.env** - Environment variables unchanged (test keys retained)

## Docker Network Configuration

**Created Network**:
```bash
docker network create f1r3fly
```

**Network Properties**:
- Name: `f1r3fly`
- Driver: `bridge`
- Scope: `local`
- Used by all containers

## Container Configuration Summary

| Container | Configuration File | Changes | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| rnode.bootstrap | shard-with-autopropose.yml | None | ✅ Working |
| rnode.validator1 | shard-with-autopropose.yml | None | ✅ Working |
| rnode.validator2 | shard-with-autopropose.yml | None | ✅ Working |
| rnode.validator3 | shard-with-autopropose.yml | None | ✅ Working |
| autopropose | shard-with-autopropose.yml | Health check fix | ✅ Fixed |
| rnode.readonly | observer.yml | None | ✅ Working |
| rnode.validator4 | validator4.yml | None | ✅ Working |

## Health Check Evolution

### Attempted Solutions (Not Used)

1. **HTTP Health Server**
   - Attempted to add Flask-based health endpoint
   - Too complex for simple health check
   - Reverted

2. **Process Detection Commands**
   ```yaml
   # Failed attempts:
   test: ["CMD", "pgrep", "-f", "autopropose.py"]  # pgrep not available
   test: ["CMD", "ps", "aux"]                       # ps not installed
   test: ["CMD", "pidof", "python3"]                # Doesn't detect PID 1
   test: ["CMD", "pidof", "python3.9"]              # Doesn't detect PID 1
   ```

3. **Final Working Solution**
   ```yaml
   test: ["CMD", "test", "-f", "/proc/1/exe"]
   ```

## Port Mappings (Unchanged)

No changes were made to port mappings. Current configuration:

| Service | Host Ports | Container Ports |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Bootstrap | 40400-40405 | 40400-40405 |
| Validator1 | 40410-40415 | 40400-40405 |
| Validator2 | 40420-40425 | 40400-40405 |
| Validator3 | 40430-40435 | 40400-40405 |
| Validator4 | 40440-40445 | 40400-40405 |
| Observer | 40451-40453 | 40401-40403 |

## Environment Variables (Unchanged)

No modifications to `.env` file. Test keys retained for development environment.

## Volume Mounts (Unchanged)

Standard volume mounts preserved:
- `./conf/` → `/var/lib/rnode/`
- `./genesis/` → `/var/lib/rnode/genesis/`
- `./data/<hostname>/` → `/var/lib/rnode/`
- `./certs/` → `/var/lib/rnode/`

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Health Checks**
   - Consider implementing proper HTTP health endpoint in AutoPropose
   - Or remove health check if monitoring is handled externally

2. **Security**
   - Replace all test keys in `.env`
   - Generate new TLS certificates
   - Use secrets management system

3. **Performance**
   - Add resource limits to containers
   - Configure log rotation
   - Implement proper monitoring

## Rollback Instructions

To revert all changes:

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose -f shard-with-autopropose.yml down

# Restore original files
mv shard-with-autopropose.yml.backup shard-with-autopropose.yml

# Restart services
docker-compose -f shard-with-autopropose.yml up -d
```

## Testing Verification

All changes were tested and verified:
- ✅ Health check passes for all containers
- ✅ Block production continues normally
- ✅ Network connectivity maintained
- ✅ No functional impact on blockchain operation
