# AutoPropose Health Check Fix Documentation

## Problem Statement

The AutoPropose service in the F1R3FLY Docker deployment was showing as "unhealthy" in Docker health checks despite functioning correctly and producing blocks every 30 seconds.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Timeline
1. **Initial State**: Docker Compose configured health check expecting HTTP endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/health`
2. **Discovery**: AutoPropose Python script only performed gRPC health checks internally
3. **Impact**: Cosmetic issue only - AutoPropose was working perfectly but showing "unhealthy" status

### Technical Details

**Original Health Check Configuration** (in `shard-with-autopropose.yml`):
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "python", "-c", "import requests; requests.get('http://localhost:8080/health', timeout=5)"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s
```

**Problems Identified**:
1. No HTTP server implemented in `autopropose.py`
2. Port 8080 not exposed or used by the service
3. `requests` library call failing as endpoint didn't exist

## Solution Implementation

### Attempted Solutions

#### Attempt 1: HTTP Health Server (Not Used)
- Created modified script with Flask-like HTTP server
- Added threading for health endpoint
- **Result**: Overly complex for simple health check

#### Attempt 2: Process-Based Health Checks (Partially Successful)
Multiple iterations tested:

| Command | Result | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `pgrep -f autopropose.py` | Failed | `pgrep` not available in container |
| `ps aux` | Failed | `ps` not installed in container |
| `pidof python3` | Failed | Returns no result |
| `pidof python3.9` | Failed | `pidof` doesn't detect PID 1 |

#### Final Solution: File System Check ✅
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "test", "-f", "/proc/1/exe"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s
```

### Why This Works

1. **Container Architecture**: In Docker containers, the main process runs as PID 1
2. **Process Information**: Linux stores process info in `/proc/[pid]/`
3. **Reliable Check**: `/proc/1/exe` is a symlink to the executable
4. **Always Present**: File exists as long as container is running

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Backup Original Configuration
```bash
cp shard-with-autopropose.yml shard-with-autopropose.yml.backup
```

### 2. Update Health Check
```bash
# Edit shard-with-autopropose.yml
sed -i 's/test: .*/test: ["CMD", "test", "-f", "\/proc\/1\/exe"]/' shard-with-autopropose.yml
```

### 3. Apply Changes
```bash
docker-compose -f shard-with-autopropose.yml up -d autopropose
```

### 4. Verify Health Status
```bash
# Wait for startup period (30s)
sleep 40
docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
```

## Verification

### Test Health Check Command
```bash
# Should return exit code 0 (success)
docker exec autopropose test -f /proc/1/exe
echo $?  # Should output: 0
```

### Monitor Container Health
```bash
# Should show (healthy) after startup period
docker ps | grep autopropose
# autopropose   Up X minutes (healthy)
```

## Additional Considerations

### Startup Delay Impact

AutoPropose has a 240-second (4-minute) startup delay before beginning operations:

```python
# In autopropose.py
self.startup_delay = timing_config.get('startup_delay', 240)
```

During this period:
- Container is running
- Health check passes (process exists)
- But main loop hasn't started yet
- This is expected behavior

### Alternative Health Check Methods

For different requirements, consider these alternatives:

1. **Extended Startup Period**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  start_period: 300s  # 5 minutes to cover startup delay
```

2. **No Health Check**
```yaml
# Remove healthcheck section entirely
# Simplest approach if monitoring isn't critical
```

3. **Custom Health Script**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "sh", "-c", "test -f /proc/1/exe && test -f /app/config.yml"]
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Container Minimalism**: Alpine-based containers may lack common Unix tools
2. **PID 1 Behavior**: Process detection tools behave differently for PID 1
3. **Simple Solutions**: File existence check more reliable than process detection
4. **Startup Delays**: Consider application initialization time in health checks

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur, restore original configuration:

```bash
# Stop container
docker-compose -f shard-with-autopropose.yml stop autopropose

# Restore backup
mv shard-with-autopropose.yml.backup shard-with-autopropose.yml

# Restart
docker-compose -f shard-with-autopropose.yml up -d autopropose
```

## Prevention

For future deployments:

1. **Document Health Requirements**: Clearly specify what health endpoints are needed
2. **Container Tools**: Ensure necessary debugging tools are in base image
3. **Test Health Checks**: Verify health check commands work inside container
4. **Consider Alternatives**: Sometimes no health check is better than a complex one
